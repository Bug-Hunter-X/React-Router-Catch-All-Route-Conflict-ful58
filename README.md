# React Router Catch-All Route Conflict

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router v6 where a catch-all route (`/*`) interferes with other defined routes.  The catch-all route, intended to handle 404 errors, inadvertently captures all requests, preventing other routes from working as expected.

## Problem:

The problem lies in the order and placement of routes within the `<Routes>` component. A catch-all route placed before other specific routes will always be matched, regardless of the requested URL.

## Solution:

The solution involves carefully ordering the routes within the `<Routes>` component. Always place the catch-all route at the very end to ensure it only handles paths not matched by other routes.

## How to reproduce the bug:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Observe that navigating to `/about` still shows the 404 page.

## How to fix the bug:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Examine the changes made in `AppSolution.js`.
4. Run `npm start`.
5. Observe that navigating to `/about` correctly shows the About page now.
